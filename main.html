    <p>We can say that optimization is one step further than the brute-force method of problem solving. However, that does not mean that optimization is always the best answer. In this article, we will discuss brute force, optimization, time complexity, and space complexity and compare these methods. We will also discuss how to bridge the gap between brute force and optimization. If you are a software developer and are puzzled about both of these methods, this article is for you.

        We will start by explaining time complexity and space complexity, as they are the key factors in building an efficient program.</p>
